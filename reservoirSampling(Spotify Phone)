/*
Reservoir sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly choosing k samples from a list of n items,
where n is either a very large or unknown number. Typically n is large enough that the list doesnâ€™t fit into main memory.
For example, a list of search queries in Google and Facebook.
